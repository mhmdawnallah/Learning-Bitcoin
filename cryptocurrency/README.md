# What are Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs)
A UTXO is the amount of digital currency remaining after a cryptocurrency transaction is executed. UTXOs are processed continuously and are part of the beginning and end of each transaction. There is no sense of accounts in the context of cryptocurrencies all you have is UTXOs inputs and outputs.
# Where do transaction fees come from
Anything you don't account for in the output UTXOs become the fees of the transaction even though blockchain `theoratically` can be
free but there is a competition about mining blocks and confirming transations you need to put a fee. The higher the fee is the more
sooner it's get accepted
# How wallets work ?
There isn't actually a balance value in the Blockchain just list of UTXOs. The Wallets actually calculate the UTXOs sent to you and calculate the balance
