# Testnet vs Mainnet
It's not a good idea to use Mainnet while learning about bitcoin core for three reasons to avoid:
- Transaction fees
- Blocktime (added to blockchain every 10 minutes)
- Save to play around

# What is Regtsest
For situations where interaction with random peers and blocks is unnecessary or unwanted, Bitcoin Core’s regression test mode (regtest mode) lets you instantly create a brand-new `private block chain` with the same basic rules as testnet—but one major difference: you choose when to create new blocks, so you have complete control over the environment.
